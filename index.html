        <h2>About us:</h2>
        <p>
         
          Our company started in the depths of the Big Bang. Our creaters Artin and Sean have always held a strong belief in providing an ultimate experience to their users like no other company before. Both our creators started their studies in FSWD (Full Stack Web Development) on Earth at BCIT in Vancouver, British Columbia.
          Their passion for innovative design in phone and laptop development lead them on a journey to explore other channels of research and knowledge that no other company has taken before.

          After graduating, they became partners and were accepted to become some of the first individuals to travel into space and explore galaxies in partnership with NASA. During their mission, they discovered other civilizations that had a greater understanding of how technology could be used to create a better interface. They spent 5 years on Mars, where a technology
          innovative technology site was set up to bring the greatest minds and experts in technology together. After spending years dveloping their ideas, Artin and Sean decided it was time to bring back their discoveries to Earth and share all they had learned. Thus, Star Tech was born. A burning star in the technology market.

          Beginning with our protostar, our products have developed in stars in the technology market. Each of our phones is based on the history, dynamics and evolution of it's specific galaxy. Their characteristics are closely tied to astronomy.
          Forged from the heavy metals that make up space matter, our phones have the necessary formula to keep from collapsing from it's lithium core to the carbon casing from which it shines. All our phones come to you with light weight technology and have an extended higher than average life-span in comparison to other phones in the market.
